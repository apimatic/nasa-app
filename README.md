# React⚛️ + Vite⚡ + express

This demo uses Vite to build an app with a React front end
and a Node/Express backend running in thee same repl.

## React For Front-End Development

Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) in the `src` folder to start
developing your app. All of the React `*.jsx` files reside
in the `src` folder. The Vite development server will
update your app live as you edit.

## Express.js For Back-End Development

The `server` folder contains the source code for the Express
back-end application. Edit [app.js](#server/app.js) to build
your API. Just like the front-end, Vite will update your app
live as you edit.

## Static Pages

All files placed in the [public](#public) folder are served
without pre-processing.
